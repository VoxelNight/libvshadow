libvshadow is a library to access the Volume Shadow Snapshot (VSS) format.
The VSS format is used by Windows, as of Vista, to maintain copies of data on a storage media volume.


This fork of libvshadow adds write support.
Write support is very experimental and currently only available on linux.
If you encounter any data or snapshot corruption when using this, please open an issue.


Cool features:
* You can write to snapshots
* Snapshots can be expanded to allow additional data to be written to them (as opposed to just overwriting stuff already stored in the snapshot)
* This thing tries to write over existing data if it can before adding new data to the snapshot
* Makes some attempt to minimize inter-snapshot data when performing writes


This fork has ntfs-3g as a dependency. This allows us to expand the files representing the snapshots in \System Volume Information\.


Currently known issues/limitations:
* Store bitmaps are not updated during writes
* Stores can only be expanded when opening the vss* files
* When closing a store that was expanded, unused space is not reclaimed
* Libvshadow can not remove data (i.e. shrink) a snapshot
** It can and will write over existing data and reuse block descriptors when able
* No Windows support (yet, it's totally in progress)
* Libvshadow works (almost) entirely at a block level. It doesn't know anything about NTFS
** Modifications made to snapshots may result in current timestamps being written into the snapshot
* Lots of quirks that would allow a forensic examiner to determine if the snapshot was modified (if they specifically look for them)
* Not guaranteed to not jack up your snapshots (write support is experimental)


Project information:
* Status: alpha
* Licence: LGPLv3+

Work in progress:
* Dokan library support
* Multi-threading support
* Windows write support
